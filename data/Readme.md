Get the datafile from https://www.digitalrocksportal.org/projects/16/images/65564/download/

Compile and run tools/distance_to-walls_3D.cpp on the file to create the distance-to-walls version

Alternatively, get the pre-calculated file from http://folk.ntnu.no/mortevas/distance_segmented_castle_512.ubc

Can be run with the original file, but no distance estimation.
